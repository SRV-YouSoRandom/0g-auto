# Auto Installer for 0g Storage Node

This repository contains an automated installer script to set up and run the 0g Storage Node service on an Ubuntu server. The script installs necessary tools, clones the required GitHub repository, builds the project, and sets up a systemd service to keep the node running continuously.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu server
- sudo privileges

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the 0g Storage Node service:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Cloned Repository:**

   ```bash
   cd 0g-auto
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x install_and_setup.sh
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   ./install_and_setup.sh
   ```

The script will:

- Update and install necessary packages.
- Install Rust, Cargo, and Go.
- Clone the 0g Storage Node GitHub repository.
- Build the project in release mode.
- Edit the configuration file with user inputs.
- Create and start a systemd service to run the node.

## Configuration

During the script execution, you will be prompted to enter:

- The version of the 0g Storage Node repository you want to clone (default is `v0.3.2`).
- Your miner key (must have at least 1 Testnet token).
- The script will automatically fetch the public IP address of your server.

## Systemd Service

The script will create a systemd service file at `/etc/systemd/system/zgs_node.service` with the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=ZGS Node Service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=$USER
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/0g-storage-node/run
ExecStart=/path/to/0g-storage-node/target/release/zgs_node --config config.toml
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=zgs_node

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

This service ensures that the 0g Storage Node runs continuously and restarts automatically if it crashes.

## Logs

Logs for the service can be viewed using `journalctl`:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u zgs_node.service -f
```
